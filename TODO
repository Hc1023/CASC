CASC TODOs
==========

(A) Need to update CASC script to gracefully handle temporary file splits
Explanation: When CASC 'multithreads' what it's really doing is splitting
	     the FASTA file into n splits. These split FASTAs are then independently
	     processed through CASC's pipeline. As each split is tested there are fewer
	     and fewer sequences left int he splits until eventually maybe a split is
	     empty. Currenlty these empty splits lead to warnings that are not needed,
	     something to the tune of "blah.split-4.txt does not exist"
